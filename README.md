This project explores the CarDekho Used Car Dataset to analyze patterns and trends in used car features and pricing. The focus is on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into factors influencing car prices and market behaviors.
Project Overview

The used car market is dynamic, with prices influenced by multiple factors like brand, age, mileage, and fuel type. This project uses EDA to uncover meaningful patterns and visualize relationships between key features, helping better understand the dataset.
Features

Data Cleaning: Managing missing values and handling inconsistencies.
Exploratory Analysis:
Visualizing distributions of key features like price, mileage, and year.
Analyzing relationships between features and their influence on pricing.
Insights Generation: Identifying trends in the used car market, such as the impact of brand or fuel type on price.
Key Components

1. Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information on used cars listed on CarDekho, featuring attributes such as:
Price: Target variable (dependent).
Features: Name, year, selling price, present price, fuel type, transmission, owner, and kilometers driven.
2. Workflow
Data Cleaning:
Removing or imputing missing values.
Formatting categorical and numerical features for consistency.
EDA Techniques:
Feature distribution analysis using histograms and boxplots.
Feature correlation analysis using heatmaps.
Bivariate analysis to explore relationships (e.g., mileage vs. price).
Visualization Tools:
matplotlib and seaborn for intuitive and insightful plots.
Insights

Age and Price: Older cars typically show significant depreciation in value.
Fuel Type: Diesel cars generally have higher resale values compared to petrol cars.
Mileage vs. Price: A negative correlation between mileage and price was observed.
Brand Impact: Premium brands tend to hold value better over time.
